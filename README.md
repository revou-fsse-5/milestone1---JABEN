# Development
Explain development stage from Scratch.
The difficulty of create a website is the design, because without the design we never know how to create it, after finding the right design, then i focused to create the HTML structure and CSS. All i can think is using grid view as it will help me to determine the right spot to place my image or layouting the E-commerce shop list, After that i use some transition and animation using Javascript and CSS animation to make the page more lively. Here is the list of what i was doing :

1. Create HTML Structure and HTML Sematic 
2. Create HTML Image and Media Elements
3. Create CSS Styling to make it the page more convinient to see
4. Create Typograhpy and Icon using remix icon
5. Create Optimized Responsive Design 
6. Add javascript Animation

# Depedency 
An external library is a collection of code (functions, classes, and other components) that extends the functionality of a programming language beyond what‚Äôs available in its core libraries. On my project i use : 

1. Remix Icon
>Remix Icon is a set of open-source neutral-style system symbols for designers and developers. Unlike a patchwork icon library, 2800+ icons are all elaborately crafted so that they are born with the genes of readability, consistency, and perfect pixels. Each icon was designed in "Outlined" and "Filled" styles based on a 24x24 grid. Of course, all the icons are free for both personal and commercial use.

I use remix icon to provide an icon in my website

2. Font 
I use font from google api to make text preetier and match to the design pattern

3. Javascript 
I use javascript to make carousel, dark mode using local storage and smooth slider

# Specific Design

# Deployment

if you want your website to be accessible to other people you need to deploy it. 
in this case i was using vercel to deploy my website.

`how to choose domain name`
* Prioritize Brandability: A unique, brandable domain stands out. 
* Keep It Short: Shorter domain names are easier to remember.
